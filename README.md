# Dialect_Digital_Preservation/古田镇方言保存计划

### I was born in 2004 in Gutian Town, Shanghang County, Longyan City, Fujian Province, China. The local dialect is spoken by only tens of thousands of people, and many of my peers can only understand it but not speak it. Furthermore, many of my younger siblings born after 2010 no longer speak the dialect at home. Therefore, I predict that the local dialect will disappear after my generation marries and has children, and after my grandparents pass away, leaving only a few decades. This led me to the idea of ​​preserving the dialect in digital space, providing evidence of its existence for future generations of people from my hometown.

### 笔者为2004年生人，家乡为中国福建省龙岩市上杭县古田镇，本地方言的使用人数仅有数万人左右，且同辈年轻人已有许多只会听不会讲此地方言，而2010年后出生的弟弟妹妹已有许多在家中不再接触方言，故笔者推测家乡话将在我这一代结婚生子，我的祖父辈离开后消失，仅剩几十载，于是萌生想法在数字空间中保存方言，为后世家乡人保留家乡话存在的证据
